bio: I am an early career marine ecologist. My research interests lie in furthering our understanding on marine species and their relationship with the wider environment using a multifaceted approach. I seek to determine the underpinnings of key life history behaviours in the context of anthropogenic and environmental influences to inform decisions that collectively impact marine conservation in increasingly anthropogenically-influenced environments.
