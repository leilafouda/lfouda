bio: I am an early career marine ecologist. My research interests lie in furthering our understanding and filling knowledge gaps on marine species and their relationship with the wider environment. I use novel technology including telemetry, genetic analysis, and stable isotopes to answer questions on; species behaviour and range, population dynamics, feeding ecology, and habitat use.
