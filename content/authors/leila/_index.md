bio: I am an early career marine ecologist. My research interests lie in furthering our understanding and filling knowledge gaps on marine species and their relationship with the wider environment. I have a particular interest in understanding how the life history and fitness of individuals impact their movement choices, reproductive fitness and foraging behaviour. In addition to this, I am interested in the impact of anthropogenic drivers on animal movement and habitat choices.
