My teaching philosophy...

I have co-taught **BIOL4645 Biology and Conservation of Marine Mammals** at the University of New Brunswick Saint John in Winter 2025 and 2026. This is a comprehensive upper-level biology course looks at the life histories, behaviour, reproduction, and population dynamics of seals, whales, and other marine mammals. This course combines lectures with a semester-long stepping-stone research and writing project incorproating literature review, data analysis, peer review, and final academic paper style report. 

In the field I was a teaching instructor for a field course in **Ecology and Evolution** for Queen Mary University masters students from 2018-2020. In 2018 and 2019 I taught in person at field sites in Cabo Verde; my responsibilities included developing and delivering lectures, guiding small discussion groups, supervising student work, and leading logistical management. When the course shifted to a virtual format in 2020, I developed and delivered workshops on marine mammal whistle analysis, CV development, and career paths in environmental science in and out of academia.

I have also demonstrated on undergraduate lab courses at Queen Mary University of London **BIO111 Cell Biology** and **BMD2019 Techniques in Biomedical Sciences**. In these entry level courses, I helped students develop basic laboratory techniques (e.g. pipetting, microscope use, scientific drawing) and provided constructive feedback on lab skills and assignments.
