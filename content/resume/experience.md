  description: "*Grant recipient with Dr. Christine Erbe.* Developing a bioacoustics and population-ecology study on Australian populations of killer whales (Orcinus orca) following a successfully co-written grant application. Co-ordinating and co-leading research trips to the Bremer Canyon and Exmouth field sites. Leading photo-identification and behavioural data collection. I was actively involved in data analysis, management and publication preparation utilising both MATLAB and RAVEN software. Additionally, I designed and formatted a photo-identification catalogue using FinBase. During the Bremer Canyon research trip I also took on the role of on-board naturalist for passengers, giving an introductory talk and answering questions during tours. For two weeks I supervised four Year 10 students conducting science projects on killer whale data collected in the Bremer Canyon."
