  description: "I am a part of the Center for Biodiversity and Global Change at Yale University where I work as part of the Biodiversity Movement and Global Change group. My work focuses on understanding the drivers and impacts of animal movement on a changing planet. I utilise high-resolution global animal movement data to explore space use and changes over time. I hope to identify how conservation practices and projects aid in the protection of highly mobile and migratory species."

  description: "I worked with two teams at the British Antarctic Survey. The first team analysed acoustic recordings from South Georgia. The second team (Whales from Space) was reviewing VHR satellite images collected from the Antarctic peninsula. In the acoustic monitoring project, I identified underwater sound sources. The main focus is to monitor recovering populations of baleen whales in South Georgia. In the ‘Whales From Space’ project I classified features of interest and environmental conditions within each VHF image. The main focus is to examine humpback whale (<a>Megaptera novaeangliae</a>) presence and habitat use across the year."

  description: "Passive acoustic monitoring study for marine mammals of Maryland in which I examined the effect of background noise levels on dolphin acoustics in particular key whistle characteristics. Setup, deployment, and recovery of acoustic equipment (SM3M, C-POD, SoundTrap) offshore and in the Chesapeake Bay. Whistle project development with Dr. Helen Bailey. Processed and analysed whistle structure and background noise leading to first author manuscript in Biology Letters."
