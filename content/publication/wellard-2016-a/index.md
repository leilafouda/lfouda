abstract: Observations of killer whales (<em>Orcinus orca</em>) feeding on the remains of beaked whales have been previously documented; however, to date, there has been no published account of killer whales actively preying upon beaked whales. This article describes the first field obser-vations of killer whales interacting with, hunting and preying upon beaked whales (<em>Mesoplo-don spp.</em>) on four separate occasions during 2014, 2015 and 2016 in the Bremer Sub-Basin, off the south coast of Western Australia.
