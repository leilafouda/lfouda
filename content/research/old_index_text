My research interests lie in furthering our understanding and filling knowledge gaps on marine species and their relationship with the wider environment. I use multifarious technology including telemetry, genetic analysis, and stable isotopes to answer questions on species behaviour and range, population dynamics, feeding ecology, and habitat use. 

I have extensive and varied experiences in both field and laboratory-based skills and have worked at remote field sites while conducted surveys from vessels and land. I can think quickly and adapt as situations change. In the lab I am thorough and meticulous both in an established laboratory setting and at temporary field site set ups. Furthermore, I am committed to passing on my knowledge and skills to the next generation of scientists as well as promoting peer-to-peer learning.
