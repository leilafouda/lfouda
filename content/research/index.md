My research interests lie in furthering our understanding and filling knowledge gaps on marine species and their relationship with the wider environment. I use multifarious technology including telemetry, genetic analysis, and stable isotopes to answer questions on species behaviour and range, population dynamics, feeding ecology, and habitat use. The foraging and movement ecology of many marine species are necessarily dynamic given the influence of multiple ephemeral ecological and environmental drivers on life history needs. Understanding where animals are and why is key for both individual and population fitness, particularly under current global change regimes. As a marine ecologist, I seek to determine and understand where and why marine animals conduct key life history behaviours in the context of anthropogenic and environmental influences.

## Investigating monitoring and management measures for endangered marine mammals

Examining the effectiveness of threat mitigation measures for the critically endangered North Atlantic right whale. Combining multiple technologies from acoustic gliders, vessel AIS, and mandatory slowdown events to determine the effectiveness of mitigation to reduce the threat of vessel strike.


Bioacoustic monitoring has become a preverlent tool to allow constant near-realtime monitoring of our oceans. Platforms that collect data can be take the form of eulerian and lagrangian observations that can inform us of whale presence, movemnet, and behaviour. While many marine mammals of interest vocalise a  Whale acoustic detection probability under current glider flight plans in the Dynamic Zones

## Project 2

**Ultimately my work uses a combination of novel and established technologies and quantitative
approaches to investigate the behaviour of marine species of conservation concern to help
inform decisions that collectively impact individual and population fitness in increasingly
anthropogenically-influenced ocean environments.**

I have extensive and varied experiences in both field and laboratory-based skills and have worked at remote field sites while conducted surveys from vessels and land. I can think quickly and adapt as situations change. In the lab I am thorough and meticulous both in an established laboratory setting and at temporary field site set ups. Furthermore, I am committed to passing on my knowledge and skills to the next generation of scientists as well as promoting peer-to-peer learning.
