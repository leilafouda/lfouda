My work uses a combination of novel and established technologies and quantitative
approaches to investigate the behaviour of marine species of conservation concern to help
inform decisions that collectively impact individual and population fitness in increasingly
anthropogenically-influenced ocean environments.

I use multifarious technology including telemetry, genetic analysis, and stable isotopes to answer questions on species behaviour and range, population dynamics, feeding ecology, and habitat use. 

Understanding where animals are and why is key for both individual and population fitness, particularly under current global change regimes. As a marine ecologist, I seek to determine and understand where and why marine animals conduct key life history behaviours in the context of anthropogenic and environmental influences.

## Investigating monitoring and management measures for endangered marine mammals

In a changing ocean it is crucial we understand the effectiveness of conservation action and threat mitigation measures. In the Gulf of St Lawrence there are many levels of management for the critically endangered North Atlantic right whale. By combining multiple technologies from acoustic gliders, vessel position data (AIS), whale movement patterns, and data on mandatory slowdown events I investigate the effectiveness of mitigation to reduce the threat of vessel strike.

Bioacoustic monitoring through passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) and animal-borne biologging acoustic sensors has become a preverlent tool to allow constant near-realtime monitoring of our oceans. Platforms that collect data can be take the form of eulerian and lagrangian observations that can inform us of whale presence, movemnet, and behaviour. While many marine mammals of interest vocalise a  Whale acoustic detection probability under current glider flight plans in the Dynamic Zones

## Mechanisms constraining individual success in marine megafauna

Disentangling the complex life histories of marine species is challenging, but necessary to nderstanding how foraging regimes, habitat use, and the changing environment lead to animal fitness and individual success in terms of survival and reproduction. It is necessary for local and global conservation practices as climate change continues to drive environmental changes.

In my work on *loggerhead sea turtles*, I determined how foraging choices, endogenous reserves, and variations in health indices impact individual reproductive fitness and ultimately offspring fitness. I established a **novel, minimally invasive** measure to examine changes in endogenous reserves.

I have extensive and varied experiences in both field and laboratory-based skills and have worked at remote field sites while conducted surveys from vessels and land. I can think quickly and adapt as situations change. In the lab I am thorough and meticulous both in an established laboratory setting and at temporary field site set ups. Furthermore, I am committed to passing on my knowledge and skills to the next generation of scientists as well as promoting peer-to-peer learning.
